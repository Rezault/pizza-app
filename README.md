This is Raz's Pizza, a project for Full Stack Development.
A YouTube video is found in "video.txt" in this directory, talking about the app and showing a live demonstration.

In the main directory of this project is a file called "setup.py".
Before running the server for the first time, run:

python setup.py

This will install all necessary dependencies, apply database migrations, populate the database with necessary data and collect static files.
Afterwards, just run:

python manage.py runserver

Enjoy using the website!
